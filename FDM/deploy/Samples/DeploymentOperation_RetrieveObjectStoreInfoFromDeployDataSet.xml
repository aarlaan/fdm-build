This is a sample RetrieveObjectStoreInfoFromDeployDataSet operation file for IBM FileNet Deployment Manager.
This operation retrieves object store information from a set of objects exported from a Content Platform Engine object store 
to a deploy data set. The returned information is stored in an object store half map file (either a merge or overwrite operation 
on any data existing in the half map, depending on the Retrieve mode attribute value).

An operation file contains the name of an operation, and parameters for that operation. The Deployment Manager 
command line interface is driven by an operation file. Internally, the Deployment Manager UI also generates an operation file 
for each operation invoked from the UI.

Often the easiest way to generate an operation file for repeated use with the command-line interface, 
is to perform a similar operation from the UI, and then use the temporary operation file created by the Deployment Manager as a 
starting point.

The Deployment Manager UI stores each temporary operation file in a time stamped folder under the Temp folder in the deployment 
tree.

The parameters in this operation file are documented in the "Deployment operation formats" topic in the online help.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in DeploymentOperation.xsd.
