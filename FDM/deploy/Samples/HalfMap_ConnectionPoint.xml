This is a sample connection point half map file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager
A connection point half map file holds identifying information about connection points from a single environment.

The simplest way to create an connection point half map is from the FileNet Deployment Manager UI.
An empty connection point half map is created with each new environment configuration.
Likewise, the easiest way to populate this file with values from a P8 environment is via the Retrieve Data action in the environment configuration editor in the Deployment Manager UI.
You can automate the population of this file by calling the Deployment Manager's command line interface.
IBM does not recommend editing this file directly unless you have a need to automate the retrieval of connection ponit information beyond what is provided by that interface.

The parent environment is determined by the location of the half map file, and is not contained within the file itself.

Each Item element contains information about a single connection point in the environment.
	
	The "label" attribute contains a value which associates this item with an item in another half map that has the same label value
	The "Name" element contains the name of the connection point
	The "ObjectStore" element contains the symbolic name of the object store the connection point is associated with.  Can be blank
	for connection points used by legacy workflows.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in HalfMap_ConnectionPoint.xsd.
