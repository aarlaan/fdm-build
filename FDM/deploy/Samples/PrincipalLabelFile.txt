# This is a sample principal label file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager

# This file can be used as a filter when retrieving a principal half map from an LDAP repository.
# 
# The Deployment Manager will then query for only the shortnames listed below,
# and will add the associated labels.  This is particularly useful for building the 
# principal half map for a destination environment, since in that case it may not be 
# practical to retrieve principals from exported objects.

# Lines to be processed should follow the form "shortname,label"
# The label is optional
# Any whitespace around shortnames and labels will be discarded
# Lines starting with "# " and completely empty lines are ignored as comments.

# Following are a few sample shortnames with labels
fnadmin, WidgetApplicationAdministrator
fnusr, WidgetApplicationUser

# Following is a sample shortname with no label:
kraleigh
