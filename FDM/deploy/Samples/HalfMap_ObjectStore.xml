This is a sample object store half map file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager
An object store half map file holds identifying information about object stores from a single environment.  This same information is often found embedded in objects exported from the source P8 environment, and needs to be converted before importing those objects into a destination environment.    A source and destionation half map are used to create a single data map, which is used when converting exported objects.

The simplest way to create an object store half map is from the FileNet Deployment Manager UI.
An empty object store half map is created with each new environment configuration.
Likewise, the easiest way to populate this file with values from a P8 environment is via the Retrieve Data action in the environment configuration editor in the Deployment Manager UI.
You can automate the population of this file by calling the Deployment Manager's command line interface.
IBM does not recommend editing this file directly unless you have a need to automate the retrieval of object store information beyond what is provided by that interface.

The parent environment is determined by the location of the half map file, and is not contained within the file itself.

Each Item element contains information about a single object store in the environment.
	"_default" is a special case used when converting Workplace objects
	
	The "label" attribute contains a value which associates this item with an item in another half map that has the same label value
	The "ID" element contains the guid that identifies the object store.
	The "Name" element contains the display name of the object store.
	The "SymbolicName" element contains the symbolic name of the object store.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in HalfMap_ObjectStore.xsd.
