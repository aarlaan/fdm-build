This is a sample UpgradeDeploymentTree operation file for IBM FileNet Deployment Manager.
This operation is used to upgrade a 5.2.0 deployment tree for use in 5.2.1.

This operation is automatically invoked when the user tries to open a 5.2.0 deployment tree within the UI after
they confirm they want to proceed with the upgrade.
 
An operation file contains the name of an operation, and parameters for that operation. The Deployment Manager 
command line interface is driven by an operation file. Internally, the Deployment Manager UI also generates an operation file 
for each operation invoked from the UI.

Often the easiest way to generate an operation file for repeated use with the command-line interface, 
is to perform a similar operation from the UI, and then use the temporary operation file created by the Deployment Manager as a 
starting point.

The Deployment Manager UI stores each temporary operation file in a time stamped folder under the Temp folder in the deployment 
tree.

The parameters in this operation file are documented in the "Deployment operation formats" topic in the online help.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in DeploymentOperation.xsd.
