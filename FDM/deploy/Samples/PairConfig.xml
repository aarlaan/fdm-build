This is a sample source-destination pair configuration file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager.
The information in a source-destination pair file is used to identify a source and destination environment, and an associated set of data maps.

The simplest way to create a pair configuration is from the FileNet Deployment Manager UI.
A new pair configuration can be created via the "New..." wizard, or an existing pair configuration can be copied from within the UI.
Likewise, the easiest way to edit the parameters in this file and ensure valid values and syntax is via the Deployment Manager UI.
IBM does not recommend editing this file directly unless you have a need to automate the creation or modification of a pair configuration.

The name of the pair is take from the name of the folder containing the config file, and is not contained within the config file itself.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in PairConfig.xsd.

	<!-- The Source tag's name attribute identifies the source-destination pair's source environment.  This string must match the name of the folder containing the source environment definition  -->

	Each DataFile element contains information about a data map file used for asset conversion.  
	"ObjectStore" and "Principal " are the only valid types in this release.  
	The value of the "use" attribute must be "yes" or "no".  If "yes", this data map will be used when converting assets.
