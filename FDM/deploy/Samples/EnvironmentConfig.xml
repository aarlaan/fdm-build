This is a sample environment configuration file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager
The information in an environment configuration file identifies a P8 environment, its description and connection information.

The simplest way to create an environment configuration is from the FileNet Deployment Manager UI.
A new environment configuration can be created via the "New..." wizard, or an existing environment configuration can be copied from within the UI.
Likewise, the easiest way to edit the parameters in this file and ensure valid values and syntax is via the Deployment Manager UI.
IBM does not recommend editing this file directly unless you have a need to automate the creation or modification of an environment configuration.

The name of the pair is take from the name of the folder containing the config file, and is not contained within the config file itself.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in EnvironmentConfig.xsd.
