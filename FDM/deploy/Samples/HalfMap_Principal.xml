This is a sample security principal half map file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager
A principal half map file holds identifying information about principals (users and groups) from a single environment.  This same information is often found embedded in objects exported from the source P8 environment, and needs to be converted before importing those objects into a destination environment.  A source and destionation half map are used to create a single data map, which is used when converting exported objects.

The simplest way to create a principal half map is from the FileNet Deployment Manager UI.
An empty principal half map is created with each new environment configuration.
Likewise, the easiest way to populate this file with values from a P8 environment is via the Retrieve Data action in the environment configuration editor in the Deployment Manager UI.
You can automate the population of this file by calling the Deployment Manager's command line interface.
IBM does not recommend editing this file directly unless you have a need to automate the retrieval of principal information beyond what is provided by that interface.

The parent environment is determined by the location of the half map file, and is not contained within the file itself.

Each Item element contains information about a single principal in the environment.
	The "label" attribute contains a value which associates this item with an item in another half map that has the same label value
	The "SID" element contains the principal's unique security identifier.
	The "ShortName" element contains the principal's short (login) name.
	The "DisplayName" element contains the principal's display name.
	The "PrincipalType" element indicates whether the principal is a user (0) or a group (1)
