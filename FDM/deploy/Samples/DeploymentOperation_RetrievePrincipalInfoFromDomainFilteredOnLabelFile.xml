This is a sample RetrievePrincipalInfoFromComain operation file for IBM FileNet Deployment Manager.
This operation retrieves security principal information from an LDAP repository via an IBM FileNet P8 environment, filtering 
the results to retrieve data only for those principals identified in a specified text file, containing the short name and 
(optionally) a label for each principal to be retrieved. The format is: shortname, label (each entry on a separate line). The 
returned information is stored in a principal half map file (either a merge or overwrite operation on any data existing in the 
half map, depending on the mode attribute value).

An operation file contains the name of an operation, and parameters for that operation. The Deployment Manager 
command line interface is driven by an operation file. Internally, the Deployment Manager UI also generates an operation file 
for each operation invoked from the UI.

Often the easiest way to generate an operation file for repeated use with the command-line interface, 
is to perform a similar operation from the UI, and then use the temporary operation file created by the Deployment Manager as a 
starting point.

The Deployment Manager UI stores each temporary operation file in a timestamped folder under the Temp folder in the deployment 
tree.

The parameters in this operation file are documented in the "Deployment operation formats" topic in the online help.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in DeploymentOperation.xsd.
