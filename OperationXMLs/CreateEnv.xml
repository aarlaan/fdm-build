This is a sample ReassignObjectStore operation file for the IBM FileNet Deployment Manager.
This operation clones the half map identified in the type attribute from the specified source environment folder to the 
specified destination environment folder (either a merge or overwrite operation on any data existing in the half map, 
depending on the Retrieve mode attribute value).

An operation file contains the name of an operation, and parameters for that operation. The Deployment Manager 
command line interface is driven by an operation file. Internally, the Deployment Manager UI also generates an operation file 
for each operation invoked from the UI.

Often the easiest way to generate an operation file for repeated use with the command-line interface, 
is to perform a similar operation from the UI, and then use the temporary operation file created by the Deployment Manager as a 
starting point.

The Deployment Manager UI stores each temporary operation file in a timestamped folder under the Temp folder in the deployment 
tree.

The parameters in this operation file are documented in the "Deployment operation formats" topic in the online help.

For information on valid syntax, please refer to the XML schema in DeploymentOperation.xsd.
